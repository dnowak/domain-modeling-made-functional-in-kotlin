Examples from [Domain Modeling Made Functional Tackle Software Complexity with Domain-Driven Design and F#](https://pragprog.com/titles/swdddf/domain-modeling-made-functional/) book translated to [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)

## Idea

I was looking for production like examples of code based on Functional Programming paradigm. 
I found the aforementioned book which focuses on using Functional Programming with Domain Driven Design.
The book contains extensive code samples
So I found even more than I was looking for ;-).

I try to apply FP but in Kotlin. So I thought that it could be interesting to convert the code from book to Kotlin.

## Changes

It is not 1 to 1 copy. I have changed the original in several areas:
* implementation is based on [Arrow](https://arrow-kt.io/) - functional library for Kotlin
* data validation is based on arrow types
* 

## Original Code

The code in */src/original* directory was copied from sources attached to the book.
